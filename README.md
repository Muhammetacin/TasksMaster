TasksMaster is a demonstration application which will grow in time into a full-fledged web (and maybe even a mobile) application that showcases my abilities as a developer. 
My goal is to use techniques that are relevant to the trends and I will try to apply these hands-on approaches to make this app robust, secure and readable.

What have I used so far?
* Clean architecture
* JWT tokens for authentication & authorization
* Unit testing
* REST API
* C# & .NET Core principles for clean and readable entitie(s)
* Dependency Injection
* SQLite database
* Roles and role-based authorization for API endpoints

Next step is to implement a nice, simple, minimalist, clean and user-friendly Angular UI.
